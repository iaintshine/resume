About
-----

Hey guys, I'm a self - managing generalist programmer with passion to learn. I constantly go beyound current superficial knowledge in order to seek newer, faster, better, scalier ways to solve problems. These days I'm absorbed by building and maintaining high - performance, fault - tolerant and scalable distributed services designed for gaming and players in mind. And yeah, I love working with open source technology.


Areas of Expertise

Technical Highlights

Experience
----------

**Platform Architect and Engineer, Reality Pump**

September 2012 - present

Mainly responsible for server side R&D. Researching distributed systems, distributed programming methodologies and concurrency patterns and incorporating them into the game development.

Projects:

* Topware's Platform 

* Two Worlds II Online Backend

* G2Liveμ 

**Backend Technology Solution Engineer, Better Reality**

May 2014 - June 2014

As a solution engineer I was working closely with the client by providing necessary documentation and expertise during the evaluation process of the backend platform for their needs. Custom solution was designed from the ground up exactly for their needs with scalability in mind. The backend system has a distributed nature and employs the microservice architecture where services can communicate using RPC (thrift) calls or can post events to global message bus with advance routing capabilities (rabbitmq). Services are discovered using seperate distributed service discovery orchestrator and all events in the system are audited by the central auditing service. User facing features:

* Email and social registration, annonymous accounts support (full profile transfer possible) 
* Standard and incremental achievements with social comparision charts
* Arbitrary data Geo - leaderboards with hierarchical data drilling (world, zone, country, state, local area, friends/social circle)
* Advance privacy options (location, division restriction)
* Location pinning - user might choose for which country one wants to play for        

**Engine Architect and Developer, Reality Pump**

January 2012 - September 2012

Working closely with Lead Engine Programmer, I take responsibility for high level decisions regarding, low – level technologies, to be used and researched in a modern engine crafted internally at Reality Pump studios. Research topics:

* R&D of a new solutions to n – way threading of game technologies (lock – less subsystem communications, task – stealing job scheduling, property based and observer based distribution changes using distribution controller).
* Responsible for design and implementation of G2Live system - service abstracting platform specific online social and multiplayer gaming services with backends for Valve's Steamworks, Sony Playstation Network, Xbox Live, Apple's Game Center and internal lightweight dedicated solution called G2Liveμ. Each of the backend is fully asynchronus and allows to play without internet connection because of the support for local data caching with embedded SQLite.     
* Design and development of new virtual file system allowing great performance, flexibility and rapid prototyping (custom compression algorithm – dictionary based deflate, to allow seeking in compressed file packages, hot – asset reloading, file system queries, flat and recursive directory iterators, URI based path resolver, virtual mount points e.g. network mount point, DVD mount point, etc). 


**Engine Architect and Developer, Mobile Division, Reality Pump**

March 2011 - January 2012

Responsible for managing a full life cycle of a new lightweight cross - platform game engine from designing through implementing to testing. Engine was designed from ground up for ease of use and optimized for mobile platforms. Features highlight:

* R&D 3D – ET technology implemented and SIMD optimized for all supported platforms. http://www.3d-et.com/en/index.html
* To prevent thread oversubscription task requesting job scheduler was incorporated and used across subsystems
* For fast assets iteration remote (on device) hot – asset reloading client subsystem was written with native dedicated server for Mac OS X and Windows platforms


**PS3 Programmer, Reality Pump**

October 2010 - March 2011

Hired as a PlayStation 3 platform specialist at the end of the Two Worlds II project lifetime to be support for a Lead Graphics Programmer. Mainly responsible for low – level SPU kernels programming. Some of the tasks include:

* Re - implementing HLSL GPU Navier – Stokes kernels to SPU
* Porting of internally used SIMD - friendly XNAMath library to PPU and SPU Units

**Senior Engine Programmer and Architect**

March 2009 – October 2012

As an engine programmer I took responsibility for general rendering technology and low – level optimization and system programming. I analyzed game runs to find bottlenecks in both CPU and GPU sides using GPAD, PIX, RAZOR, VTUNE, XCODE INSTRUMENTS and other profiling and tuning software. CPU side features were optimized using pipelining and vector intrinsic. GPU features were optimized for all platforms utilizing hardware to maximum. As an engine architect responsible for designing easy to use, maintainable and readable APIs. Incorporating design patterns, high – level programming methodologies, designing classes and interactions using UML modeling language, were common practice.

**Game and Engine Developer, Gamelion Sp. z o.o**

July 2007 - December 2007

Responsible for managing full life cycle of programming a Global Cricket project from designing through implementing to testing. The game was developed by Gamelion Studios, published by Nokia and embedded in every Nokia E51 as the game showing rendering capabilities of the device. As a programmer responsible for writing a game engine that could be reused in future similar sport titles. 

Education
---------

**Jagielonian University in Cracow, European Games Academy, Postgraduate Studies**

Completed postgraduate studies at 3D Games Programming. 

**Rzeszow University of Technology, Master of Science Degree, Computer Engineering**

Completed studies at Computer Engineering majoring in Information System with a very 
good result. 

* Diploma thesis title: “Cross – platform system abstraction layer and 3d game 
engine for developing advanced 3d games for mobile platforms”.*

Teaching
--------

Periodically through studies being speaker at ‘KOD’ scientific group. I gave
